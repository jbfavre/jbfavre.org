Les voici rassemblés pour ceux qui les auraient raté.

Bonne lecture

## Tools

[Giving HTTPie a Chance](http://ma.ttias.be/giving-httpie-chance/)
: Maybe it's time to give ye ol' curl some competition.

## Dev

### GIT

[I dropped a large binary object in Git ... now what?](http://www.sadev.co.za/content/i-dropped-large-binary-object-git-now-what)
: or how do I remove a file from Git, including the history. This came out of a discussion with some ALM Rangers (in fact the title was from Willy-Peter himself!) and I thought it is too good not to share. In addition I’ve added some other information I learnt since then !

## Databases

### MySQL

[Causal Consistency](https://blog.mariadb.org/causal-consistency/)
: Causal consistency is one of the consistency criteria that can be used on distributed databases as consistency criteria.  
Distributed database provides causal consistency if read and write operations that are causally related are seen by every node of the distributed system in the same order. Concurrent writes may be seen in different order in diffrent nodes.  Causal consistency is waker than sequential consistency but stronger than eventual consistency. See earlier blog for more detailed description on [eventual consistency](https://blog.mariadb.org/eventually-consistent-databases-state-of-the-art/).

### Cassandra

[Cassandra: Intro to Designing Tables Access, Query and so on.](http://architects.dzone.com/articles/cassandra-intro-designing)
: Cassandra is a fast NoSQL data store that has the distributed capabilities of Amazon's DynamoDB and Google's BigTable data structure.  
Cassandra is a scalable, high available and partition tolerant database that had focused  specifically with 'AP' of CAP theorem, however, 'C' can be achieved with higher performance penalty, by getting a quorum of all the nodes participating in the cluster.  
I think that is already some background, so we should really start on the important stuff of this write-up.

## Management

[Scrum Teams, "PURIFFY" your Sprint Increment!](http://architects.dzone.com/articles/scrum-teams-puriffy-your)
: In Scrum, each sprint produces an increment, which is a partial and potentially releasable product. To be releasable, the increment must meet all acceptance criteria and pass different categories of tests. Consequently, each sprint should consider all testing activities required for a releasable product. Unfortunately, during my work on different projects, I have observed that many teams focus only on a subset of testing activities during the sprint (Mainly unitary testing). 

[Culture is the Core of Your Organization](http://agilitrix.com/2015/02/culture-core-organization/)
: Culture is at the core of your organization. Everything in your organization informs culture. And vice-versa: culture informs everything in your organization. Here is an illustration
