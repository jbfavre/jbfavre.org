Les voici rassemblés pour ceux qui les auraient raté.

### Management

[Agile: Team Agreements](http://engineering.opendns.com/2014/11/13/agile-team-agreements/)
: This is the first part of a multi-part series about how the OpenDNS Dashboard team adapted the practices of agile software development to our needs – the lessons learned, the mistakes made, and what has continued to work well.

[Five Tips for Tactical Management](http://feeds.dzone.com/~r/zones/architects/~3/9fsVKCngxPE/five-tips-tactical-management)
: Sometimes, you just need to get on with the work. You need to give yourself some breathing room so you can think for a while. Here are some tips that will help you tackle the day-to-day management work:

[On writing post-mortem analyses](https://t37.net/on-writing-post-mortem-analyses.html)
: You just fought a very tough battle to fix something that failed miserably. Whatever it was, production deployment failure, security breach or missed unmissable sales process, the crisis if finally over. Still, you’re not done yet. As everyone congratulate each other, or silently leave the war room to breath some fresh air after a sleepless night, there’s one thing to do while things are still fresh in your mind.

### Development

[This Lossless PNG Optimization You’re Probably Not Using Shrunk One File an Extra 39%](http://zoompf.com/blog/2014/11/png-optimization)
: At Zoompf we routinely get asked questions about the best way to optimize images for performance. The other day, however, we received one question that left us scratching our heads. After some detective work, we uncovered a little known, yet extremely effective tactic for lossless PNG reduction that you very likely aren’t using (but should).

[Mozilla announced Firefox Dev Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)
: Firefox Developer Edition brings your core dev tools together with some powerful new ones that will extend your ability to work across multiple platforms from one place. It’s everything you’re used to, only better. And only from Firefox.

#### Android

[A Guide to Android Recycler and CardView](http://feeds.dzone.com/~r/zones/architects/~3/0wz6J3G7ek8/guide-android-recycler-and-cardview)
: The new support library in Android L (Lollipop) introduced two new UI widgets: RecyclerView and CardView. The RecyclerView is a more advanced and more flexible version of the ListView. This new component is a big step because the ListView is one of the most used UI widgets. The CardView widget, on the other hand, is a new component that does not "upgrade" an existing component. In this tutorial, I'll explain how to use these two widgets and show how we can mix them. Let's start by diving into the RecyclerView.

### Big Data

[How Cerner Uses CDH with Apache Kafka](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/11/how-cerner-uses-cdh-with-apache-kafka/)
: Over the years, Cerner Corp., a leading Healthcare IT provider, has utilized several of the core technologies available in CDH, Cloudera’s software platform containing Apache Hadoop and related projects—including HDFS, Apache HBase, Apache Crunch, Apache Hive, and Apache Oozie. Building upon those technologies, we have been able to architect solutions to handle our diverse ingestion and processing requirements.

[Genie 2.0: Second Wish Granted!](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/11/genie-20-second-wish-granted.html)
: A little over a year ago we announced Genie, a distributed job and resource management tool. Since then, Genie has operated in production at Netflix, servicing tens of thousands of ETL and analytics jobs daily. There were two main goals in the original design of Genie:

#### Analytics

[Using R: R Class for Wildfire Scientists](http://feeds.dzone.com/~r/zones/architects/~3/dNwQsx-iWOk/r-class-wildfire-scientists)
: Mazama Science has just finished creating class materials on using R for the AirFire team at the USFS Pacific Wildland Fire Sciences Lab in Seattle, Washington. This team of scientists works on monitoring and modeling wildfire emissions, smoke and air quality. The AirFire team has granted permission to release these class materials to the public in the interest of encouraging scientists in other agencies to experiment with R for their daily work. A detailed syllabus follows.

[22 tips for better data science](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/xn/detail/6448529:BlogPost:222073)
: These tips are provided by Dr Granville, who brings 20 years of varied data-intensive experience working with successful start-ups, small companies across various industries, and eBay, Visa, Microsoft, GE and Wells Fargo.

#### DataViz

[Plotting Data Online via Plotly and Python](http://feeds.dzone.com/~r/zones/architects/~3/49jEwkc7Ees/plotting-data-online-plotly)
: I don’t do a lot of plotting in my job, but I recently heard about a website called Plotly that provides a plotting service for anyone’s data. They even have a plotly package for Python (among others)! So in this article we will be learning how to plot with their package. Let’s have some fun making graphs!

### Architecture

[Three Reasons You Probably Don’t Need Multi-Data Center Capabilities](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HighScalability/~3/TPNZGFa-gIA/three-reasons-you-probably-dont-need-multi-data-center-capab.html)
: For many organizations that care a lot about strong consistency and low latency or haven’t already built a fault tolerant application tier on top of their database, adding a multiple data center (MDC) database implementation may create more complexity or unintended consequences than meaningful benefits. Why might that be?

[Chef Provisioning: Infrastructure As Code](https://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/11/12/chef-provisioning-infrastructure-as-code/)
: Chef Provisioning is now a Release Candidate, included in the ChefDK! This powerful new Chef featureset lets you idempotently create and converge machines, images, load balancers and other infrastructure, no matter where they are: cloud, bare metal, virtual machines, or containers. This is the next step in configuration management: Infrastructure as Code.

[Nifty Architecture Tricks from Wix - Building a Publishing Platform at Scale](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HighScalability/~3/OofjaeQZr14/nifty-architecture-tricks-from-wix-building-a-publishing-pla.html)
: Wix operates websites in the long tale. As a HTML5 based WYSIWYG web publishing platform, they have created over 54 million websites, most of which receive under 100 page views per day. So traditional caching strategies don’t apply, yet it only takes four web servers to handle all the traffic. That takes some smart work.

[Why Use REST for Data Access](http://feeds.dzone.com/~r/zones/architects/~3/356vYT4fNDM/why-use-rest-data-access)
: In the last two blogs, we tackled the issue of how REST is a solution to a connected enterprise followed by discussions on What is REST.

[On Resource Scarcity, Application Servers and Micro-services](http://feeds.dzone.com/~r/zones/architects/~3/uJ0eX4NZqHE/resource-scarcity-application)
: While attending JavaZone recently, I went to a talk by Neal Ford. To be honest, the talk was not something mind-blowing, many tools he showed were either outdated or not best of breed, but he stated a very important fact: application servers are meant to address resources scarcity by sharing resources, while those resources are no more scarce in this day and age.

[Microservices in Microcontainers with Docker](http://feeds.dzone.com/~r/zones/architects/~3/CJOfni5ffP4/microservices-microcontainers)
: After first using fat Docker containers to build PAAS like capabilities (http://www.slideshare.net/IlkkaAnttonen/open-slava-2014ilkkaanttonen) I have now switched my thinking towards simpler containers. The size of the core-container crept to over a gigabyte whereas microcontainers can be kept very small, in the megabytes or tens of megabytes range instead of hundreds of megabytes.

[Tunable Triggers for Automatic Horizontal Scaling](http://feeds.dzone.com/~r/zones/architects/~3/yJDXM7H1gKE/tunable-triggers-automatic)
: In our recent publication, we shared our outstanding new Jelastic Multi Nodes feature, which allows you to manually scale all the middleware stacks in your environment, providing numerous possibilities for increasing your application’s performance and reliability.

#### Network

[Networking's atomic unit: Going small to scale up](http://feeds.dzone.com/~r/zones/architects/~3/kujqn-Xoc5Y/networkings-atomic-unit-going)
: The major IT trends are all being driven by what can probably best be summarized as more. Some of the stats are actually fairly eye-popping:

#### Varnish

[Overriding Origin TTL in Varnish, or My Beginner's Mistake](http://www.fastly.com/blog/varnish-tip-beginner-mistake)
: A long time ago, I was helping out at a gaming conference where there was an intranet CMS using a Twitter search plugin. Unfortunately, the rather saturated Internet connection was slowing down all of the Twitter search requests. Each page needed 4 searches, at 500ms each, for a total of 2-3 seconds per page.

[Scaling up the dmcache tests](https://www.varnish-software.com/blog/scaling-dmcache-tests)
: Following up on Mondays test of dmcache we decided to scale it up a bit, to get better proportions between RAM, SSD and HDD. So we took the dataset and made it 10 times bigger. It is now somewhere around 30GB with an average object size of 800Kbyte. In addition we made the backing store for Varnish ten times biggers as well, increasing it from 2GB to 20GB. This way we retain the cache hit rate of around 84% but we change the internal cache hit rates significantly.

[Accelerating your HDD with dm-cache or bcache](https://www.varnish-software.com/blog/accelerating-your-hdd-dm-cache-or-bcache)
: As you might or might not know we’ve been working on this storage backend for a year now, built for handling large data volumes like the ones we see in online video and CDNs. The new storage backend is written with performance in mind leveraging some novel ideas we have to make things go a lot faster. If you want to know more you can get in touch with me or come to one of our summits where I’ll be presenting.

### Virtualization

[5 Evolving Docker Technologies](http://www.activestate.com/blog/2014/11/5-evolving-docker-technologies)
: Since the announcement of Docker approximately 18 months ago there has been an explosion of new technology in this space. Although the list is becoming very long, here I will outline five evolving Docker-related technologies that are driving the direction that cloud technology is going.

[CoreOS Brings Kubernetes to Any Cloud Platform](http://coreos.com/blog/kubernetes-on-any-platform/)
: If you aren’t familiar with Kubernetes, it is a container cluster manager from Google that offers a unique workflow for managing containers across multiple machines. We have written about Kubernetes and CoreOS in a tutorial series (Part 1, Part 2) here for those wanting to learn more. Last week Google announced Google Container Engine, which enables you to run and manage Docker containers on Google Cloud Platform’s virtual machines.

[Weekend Enjoyment: CoreOS Deployment Videos](http://coreos.com/blog/coreos-weekend-videos/)
: For your weekend enjoyment, we’ve posted a few videos that showcase unique CoreOS deployments. First, Playstation walks through how their developers set up structured but customizable dev environments for their software teams using CoreOS, docker and systemd-nspawn.

### Monitoring

[How to Gain & Keep Internal Acceptance for APM](http://apmblog.compuware.com/2014/11/13/gain-keep-internal-acceptance-apm/)
: Demonstrating the value of any tool can be tricky. There’s no “12 Step Program” you can follow to guarantee success. It’s not like trying to quit smoking or lose weight. There’s proven data spread over years or research showing how to do those things. In this article I will talk about some successes and roadblocks I’ve encountered demonstrating the value of Dynatrace within our organization.

[Reducing your Incident Resolution Time](http://blog.pagerduty.com/2014/11/reducing-incident-resolution-time/)
: A little while back, we blogged on key performance metrics that top Operations teams track. Mean time to resolution (MTTR) was one of those metrics. It’s the time between failure & recovery from failure, and it’s directly linked to your uptime. MTTR is a great metric to track; however, it’s also important to avoid a myopic focus.

[Announcing support for Apache Thrift RPC](http://packetbeat.com/blog/apache-thrift-monitoring.html)
: Apache Thrift is a communication protocol and RPC framework initially created at Facebook. It is often used in microservices architectures because it provides better performance when compared to the more obvious HTTP/RESTFul API choice, while still supporting a wide range of programming languages and frameworks.

### Databases

[The eBay Secret to Database Scaling](http://gomorpheus.com/blog/2014-10-31-the-ebay-secret-to-database-scaling)
: TL;DR: eBay uses MongoDB to perform a number of tasks involving large amounts of data. Such projects include search suggestions, cloud management, storage of metadata, and the categorization of merchandise. The search suggestions are a key feature of their web site, and MongoDB provides them with a way to provide these suggestions to users quickly.

[Data modelling: when to embed, when to refer](http://blog.couchbase.com/data-modelling-when-embed-or-refer)
: When working with relational databases we're used to strictly normalising our data: we hold a canonical, non-duplicative, instance of each item of data. That gives us almost unlimited scope for queryability and makes consistency a breeze.

#### ElasticSearch

[ELK in the Wild: At Nike, Code is King](http://www.elasticsearch.org/blog/elk-wild-code-king/)
: Over 60 million people have logged on to Nike.com not only to purchase products, but also to participate in Web-based experiences like the Nike+ running app to track their fitness goals. This large, vibrant community of fitness enthusiasts has run over a billion miles, burned over 12 billion calories, and accomplished over 65 million personal fitness goals. There’s a constant flow of apps being developed now, like the World Cup app, the Nike Skate App, and the Nike Football app, to name a few.

[Scaling Elasticsearch to Hundreds of Developers](http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2014/11/scaling-elasticsearch-to-hundreds-of-developers.html)
: Yelp uses Elasticsearch to rapidly prototype and launch new search applications, and moving quickly at our scale raises challenges. In particular, we often encounter difficulty making changes to query logic without impacting users, as well as finding client library bugs, problems with multi-tenancy, and general reliability issues. As the number of engineers at Yelp writing new Elasticsearch queries grew, our Search Infrastructure team was having difficulty supporting the multitude of ways engineers were finding to send queries to our Elasticsearch clusters. The infrastructure we designed for a single team to communicate with a single cluster did not scale to tens of teams and tens of clusters.

[Introducing Raigad - An Elasticsearch Sidecar](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/11/introducing-raigad-elasticsearch-sidecar.html)
: Netflix has very diverse data needs. Those needs fall anywhere between rock-solid durable datastores, like Apache Cassandra and lossy in-memory stores, such as the current incarnation of Dynomite. Somewhere in that spectrum is the need to store, index and search documents. This is where Elasticsearch has found a niche in Netflix.

#### Redis

[Using Redis to Create a Blazing Fast API App](https://redislabs.com/blog/using-redis-to-create-a-blazing-fast-api-app)
: Every year New York comes alive with tens and even hundreds of database professionals flocking to it to participate in Database Month. This is a video recording of a seesion given by Tung Nguyen from Bleacher Report during Database Month 2014. In it, Tung reviews how Bleacher Report had built a blazingly fast API application using Redis. If you haven't already, we recommend that you also check out his blog post on how he tested our Redis Cloud service with live traffic.

### MySQL

[Everything about MySQL Users and Logins You Didn’t Know and Were Afraid to Ask](http://mysqlserverteam.com/everything-about-mysql-logins/)
: Logging into a MySQL server is generally dead simple—supply a username, a password, and you’re all set!  
There are, however, more complex use cases such as when making use of our Enterprise Authentication plugins. It’s also sometimes helpful to have a more detailed understanding of what happens “under the hood”. So I’ll attempt to lift the hood and walk you through all of the nitty-gritty details regarding exactly just what happens when you log into a MySQL server.

[Log rotate and the (deleted) MySQL log file mystery](http://www.percona.com/blog/2014/11/12/log-rotate-and-the-deleted-mysql-log-file-mystery/)
: When running logrotate for MySQL (after proper setting the /etc/logrotate.d/mysql conf file) from anacron, there’s a situation that you might potentially face if the user and password used to execute the “flush logs” command is stored in, for example, /root/.my.cnf file.

### Couchbase

[Distributed Databases and Replication Design](http://blog.couchbase.com/distributed-databases-and-replication-design)
: One of the most important elements of distributed database architecture is replication. In fact, it defines the database architecture. It determines whether or not the data is consistent / available.

### Cassandra

[Target at Cassandra Summit 2014: Pioneering NoSQL in a Big Enterprise](http://planetcassandra.org/blog/interview/target-at-cassandra-summit-2014-pioneering-nosql-in-a-big-enterprise/)
: Cassandra Summit 2014 was a fantastic event that gave us an opportunity to meet other companies and hear stories, use cases, and technical tutorials about Apache Cassandra. My team and I also came to the event to share a story of our own; I work on the team that makes api.target.com.
